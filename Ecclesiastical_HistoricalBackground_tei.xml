				<head>Historical Background</head>
			<div><head>Cathedral and Diocese </head>
				<p>Although there is some evidence, archaeological and historical, for Christianity in London in the fourth century (Restitutus, bishop of London, attended the
				council of Arles in 314), the visible history of the church in London really begins with the establishment in 604 of St Paul&apos;s Cathedral, probably on one of the two low hills
				where the Romans built this city. St Augustines mission had landed in 597, commanded by Pope Gregory to establish sees at London and Tork and seven years later Athelberht of kent built
				the cathedral for London&apos;s bishop, Mellitus, the friend of Augustine. Athelberht&apos;s death brought a reversion to paganism and Mellitus exile however, and the see of London was
				not re–established until late in the century by St Erkenwald (acceded 675), called St Paul&apos;s second founder, whose relics in the Middle Ages were the cathedral&apos;s greatest
				treasure.2 In the ninth century the Viking attacks of 842, 851, and 871, and the occupation of London, must have had an effect on religious life in the capital but the evidence is
				scarce. The lives of the great bishops of the tenth century, however– Theodred (acceded between 900 and 926) and Dunstan (between 957 and 950)– provide more evidence. Dunstan in
				particular is associated with monastic reform and specifically with the reform of the Westminster community. His successor Alfstan (between 950 and 964) was responsible for rebuilding
				St Pauls within a year after a great fire in 962, the first of many that were to mark its history. Edward the Confessor&apos;s transfer of the royal capital from Winchester&apos;s Old
				Minster to London&apos;s Westminster contributed to the importance of St Paul&apos;s and of its bishop. Edward appointed the first two Norman bishops of London, Robert of [umieges
				(1044) and William (between 1051 and 1075), the latter subsequently regarded as instrumental in the royal grant of a charter to London and for this reason commemorated in a mayoral
				procession to St Paul&apos;s as late as the seventeenth century. The second of the cathedral&apos;s three great fires, in 1087, produced a significant rebuilding of the cathedral begun
				by Bishop Maurice. It was perhaps largely finished by 1175, dedicated in 1240, and finally completed in the 1320s.s Bishop of London Gilbert Foliot&apos;s claim, in 1160, to
				metropolitan status for himself and London, and his refusal of subordination to the arch– bishop or church of Canterbury, must have been to some extent connected with the growing
				physical pre–eminence of the cathedral and perhaps also with the translation to it of St Erkenwald&apos;s relics, which had taken place in 1148.S (The saint&apos;s two feasts were re–established by Bishop Robert Braybrooke in 1386 and the alliterative poem on the
				saint&apos;s life may have been composec at that time.) </p>
				
				<p>Writing of the late twelfth century, keene notes, The bulk of the church... rose well above the city walls and all houses in the
				city, while its elegant and sumptuous spire, perhaps the tallest in Europe, rose higher than any building in London before 1064./ The cathedral&apos;s physical fabric has regularly
				risen and fallen: besides the fires of 962 and 1087 already mentioned, there were conflagrations in 1136 and in 1445, after which the spire was not repaired until 1462, when a copper
				and gilt weathercock, originally erected in 1421, was replaced. The third great fire occurred in 1561 when the S00 spire was struck by lightning: a smoke was espied. But sodeinly
				after, as it wer in a momente, the flame brake furth in a circle like a garlande. within a quarter of an howre... the crosse &amp; the Egle on the toppe fell downe vpon the south
				crosse Ile.8 The subsequent collection of funds, like the national collection begun seventy years later in 1631 to respond to general decay of the building, was controversial, since
				from Elizabeth&apos;s accession onward the form of the building, even its existence, was strongly tied to approval or disapproval of differing religious positions.</p> 
				
				<p>From the twelfth
				century St Paul&apos;s central role in London spectacle was established, not only in religious procession within the cathedral and its precinct, but in the secular space to the north,
				in Cheapside, which became the principal section of the route for royal entries and for reception of visitors from abroad. At least by the early fifteenth century, besides the mayoral
				election procession on 28 October there were seven other days, all in winter, when the mayor aldermen, and guilds ceremonially attended St Paul&apos;s, while the days after Pentecost
				were filled with long–established archidiaconal processions. The symbolic closeness, even identity, of civic and religious authority is shown by the ceremonial on six special feasts
				when mayori and aldermen heard vespers at St Paul&apos;s, standing in ranked order along the choir, the mayori next to the dean&apos;s staff.</p>
				
				<p>The cathedral served both city and
				kingdom and its importance not only in civic but in national life was underlined by the celebration of royal victories (Henry vII after Stoke), royal marriages (Henry VII1 and
				katherine of Aragon), and royal political alliances ([ames I and Christian of Denmark) which took place within its walls. As the cathedral provided the great stage for these moments of
				national affirmation, so too it was the venue for the display of clashing religious beliefs, particularly after the death of Henry VIII when for the rest of the century the entire
				kingdom struggled with the violent realities of religious change. Especially relevant were the conflicts centred on St Paul&apos;s liturgical observance, an important index to the
				country&apos;s theological shifts. At the cathedral the simplifying of religious observance under Edward, the reinstitution of traditional ceremony under Mary (including the feast of
				St Erkenwald), the Elizabethan completion of the Reformation, and the Laudian liturgical reform reflected in condensed form the events taking place in the country at large. That
				convocation met regularly at St Paul&apos;s meant that these visual statements were regularly accompanied by theological ones. It was the 1563 convocation of the southern province
				whose first session met at St Paul&apos;s for instance, which produced the doctrinal consensus embodied in the Thirty* Nine Articles. </p>

			<p>Though the cathedral and its precinct were important civic spaces, they were famously disorderly ones where commercial, legal, and personal business was
				conducted with all of its inherent possibilities for conflict. Because the north and south walls were pierced by opposite doors, about the middle of the nave, a shortcut might be taken
				through the centre of the cathedral, called Paul&apos;s Walk. In 1562/3 Bishop [ames Pilkington of Durham, wrote, The south alley for vsurye and Poperye, the north for Simony, and the
				Horse faire in the middest for all kind of bargains, metinges, brawlinges, murthers, conspiracies, and the font for ordin ary paimentes of money are so well knowen to all menne as the
				begger knowes his dishe. Bishop Braybrookes 1385 attempt to regulate behaviour in St Paul&apos;s is the earliest of many such injunctions.</p> 
				
				<p>Not only the cathedral building itself but
				the enclosing precinct provided the stage for activity liturgical, political, and sometimes simply dramatic. The precinct&apos;s walls, gates, and to some extent buildings seem to have
				been largely in place by the twelfth century.8 Sparrow Simpson asks how many people resided in the precinct and a recent assessment suggests it might have housed as many as 300, a
				number equivalent to the communicants in a middle sized city parish.1/ The precinct was the locale for many of the dramatic occurrences presented in this volume: for instance the plays
				in the almoner&apos;s house under Sebastian Westcote (attend– ance at which required negotiation of at least one, perhaps two, gates), the boy bishop&apos;s visits to clerical houses,
				and the spectacles and sermons offered at Paul&apos;s Cross (see Figure I, p xxxix) The cathedral precinct, sheltering its important cross and pulpit, thus offered the same mode of
				churchyard with a cross found on a smaller scale in many London parishes. Located in the northeast corner, near the site of the ancient folkmoot, the cross was firs€ mentioned in 1216.
				Its enclosing structure was shown by nineteenth–century excavations to have been 37 across.s The much–reproduced Gipkyn diptych (₯ 1620) shows various modes of audience response to
				this especially important public space, the site of public penance (including that of the cross–dressing Mary Frith, see pp 208–0), abjurations (ohn Purvey ir 1401), book burnings
				(repeatedly), even executions (after Wyatt&apos;s rebellion and the Gunpowder Plot), as well as the popular sermons whose theological messages varied so widely. S It was alsc the venue
				for several influential attacks on the stage made in the last quarter of the sixteenth century./ Sermons were not preached at Paul&apos;s Cross after 1633 though the cross lasted for
				ten years more.</p>

					<head>Parishes</head> 
					<p>The remarkable number of London parishes has been universally noticed. William Fitzstephen, writing in the 1170s at the end of the period during which the
				parishes were taking shape, says London and its suburbs had thirteen greater conventual churches and 126 lesser parochial churches, and Christopher Brooke judges that before 1250 this
				seems to have been the record in Western Christendom.18 The familiar line of development from minster to parish, beginning in the Anglo–Saxon period and largely completed by 1200, has
				been traced in London by Brooke, who notes the early existence of St Gregory&apos;s and St Faiths parishes as probable off* shoots of St Pauls. (St Faiths dedication comes perhaps from
				the ninth century.) Brooke also observes the early appearance of parishes in the northwest, with the extramural churches of St Andrew Holborn, recorded in a mid–tenth–century charter, and St
				Brides, built on an ancient Roman cemetery possibly in the tenth or eleventh century: Focusing on eastern London ]eremy Haslam has posited a slightly different pattern of evolution: an
				intentional creation of new minsters in the restoration of London after the ninth* century Viking raids, of which the first and oldest would be All Hallows Barking, covering much if
				not most of the eastern part of the City.21</p>
					
				<p>Founded mostly between the tenth and twelfth centuries, with a proliferation of tiny parishes in the eleventh century, the roster of London
				parishes was largely complete by around 1200. As in other English cities these many small parishes were served by small churches, though the four churches of the friars offered large
				interiors. Parish boundaries did not follow those of the wards, being often determined by ownership of land, and Brooke concludes that we must be looking at the outlines of the
				tenements and messuages of groups of neighbours who formed 522 the early parishes.</p> 
					<p>In London the ties between parishes and the religious houses were close. Thirteenth– and
				fifteenth–century lists of London parishes survive, with valuations: in the earlier list the citys ninety–two churches are annotated as in the patronage of either a religious house or
				a private person.2 In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries there were lawsuits, some of which the bishop of London joined, to relieve some parishes of these payments to
				institutions. The fourteenth and fifteenth centuries saw the appropriation of several parishes to monasteries: foi instance St Mary Graces appropriated All Hallows Staining, and the
				female abbey of Barking in 1385 appropriated the parish of All Hallows Barking. At the end of the fourteenth century St Paul&apos;s Cathedral held the advowson of nineteen parishes.25
				This closeness took another form when at the Dissolution of the London religious houses in 1530 four monastic churches became parochial.2</p> 
					<p>The middle of the fourteenth century saw
				several important developments in parish life Perhaps most central was the emergence of churchwardens and their various duties, beginning with fiscal responsibility for the fabric but
				developing rapidly in other directions as well Beat kimin&apos;s list of Peterborough wardens duties is almost comically comprehensive: they administered, bought, and sold property,
				organized collections on certain feasts, lent out money and various church goods, received testamentary bequests and contributions by local guilds, staged entertainments and demanded
				fees for bell–ringing or burial, while spending money on church maintenance, ornaments, salaries, subsidies, bridge–building, legal matters, priests and ceremonies.</p> 
					<p>The earliest
				English churchwardens accounts come from Bridgwater, Somerset, in 1318.2 In London the earliest accounts belong to St Mary at Hill c 1420 (there are inventories, pre– served in the
				accounts, from earlier dates). St Peter Westcheap follows in 1431, and a cluster of parishes have records from the 1450s: All Hallows Barking and St Nicholas Shambles, 1452: St Michael
				Cornhill, 1453: St Andrew Hubbard, 1454: and All Hallows on London Wall, 1455. These men (I have not found any female churchwardens in the London ac* counts) belonged to what has
				famously been called, in the seventeenth century, the middling sort.2 The 1486 pyramidal diagram from St Mary at Hill printed by Clive Burgess, which places the wealthiest parishioners near the top, provides a visual statement of the realities of parish economics since against each name is entered the
				expected contribution to the parish clerk&apos;s wage.</p> 
					<p>The development of chantries within London parishes was also a feature of the mid–four*– teenth century. Chantries had both
				negative and positive effects for the parish: the increase in staffing they produced was recognized both as a financial problem (since the original endowment was sometimes inadequate)
				and a pastoral desideratum (since the lightness of chantry duties made possible richer parish liturgical, musical, and educational services). Indeed it has recently been claimed that
				the managerial and liturgical demands imposed by these testamentary arrangements for long–term commemoration were responsible for parish growth in adminis trative, musical, and
				liturgical complexity: Nevertheless as early as 1345 the mayor complained to the dean and chapter of St Paul&apos;s that there were too few priests to sing at the cathedral in
				proportion to the number staffing the chantries. 28</p> 
					<p>Finally this period also saw the growth of the parish brotherhoods whose popularity continuec strong until their abolition by the
				Chantries Act in 1547. 2 Between the middle of the four teenth century and sixteenth century, 176 such London fraternities have been counted. In addition to the brotherhood property
				and possessions listed under parish holdings, the Chantry Certificate of 1548 shows that ten London brotherhoods were wealthy enough to file returns separate from those of the parish.
				At least three of these parish fraternities owned halls and in one of them, Trinity Hall at St Botolph without Aldersgate, playing took place.</p> 
					<p>Attempts to use parish space, both in
				churches and churchyards, for non–religious purposes began very early. Bishop of London Fulk Bassets mid–thirteenth–century strictures against plays and wrestling in churches and
				chapels may be considered just a few of many attempts to regulate the non–religious use of parish sacred space (see pp 3–4). In 1303, for instance, the rector of St Bartholomew the
				Less was reproved by the archbishop of Canterbury for allowing his parishioners to use the cemetery as their marketplace for timber, hay, and other merchandise. 2 Open space connected
				with parish churches had a myriad of uses, yet it may be that in the heyday of parish playing these spaces were being reduced. In the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries many
				London churches were engaged in extensive building and decorating, a process that, according to one historian, converted a small Romanesque box of the eleventh or twelfth centuries
				into a complex rectangle of aisles and chapels, accentuated in the fifteenth century by the addition of towers.2 The gain in beauty and comfort may have come at the expense of
				disposable open space outside the church. Nonetheless London&apos;s dramatized Palm Sunday liturgy, with its costumed and wigged singing prophets, took place mostly in the churchyard
				where the churchyard cross was the destination of the festal procession. Parish fund–raising plays took place here as well, the most notable being the summer–long plays licensed by the
				city.</p> 
					<p>Early population is a controversial subject and medieval historians differ as to the size of London before the Black Death.2 Based on a study of property₯holding in five parishes
				at the eastern end of Cheapside, Derek Reene suggested that in 1300 population might have been as high as 100, O00 people or more. Using tax returns and trade figures Pamela
				Nightingale has opted for a more conservative figure of about 6O, OO0, suggesting that different parts of the city experienced different patterns of growth. After the several fourteenth–century episodes of the plague however, the population of London was in 1400 probably
				only half what it had been in 1300, and keene has suggested that the city did not regain its pre–plague size until 1600. The estimates of SO, O00 people in 1500 and 70, O00 in 1550
				offered by Roger Finlay have become widely accepted. The latter figure depends on the crucially important population marker of mid–century, the chantry returns of 1546–8 which counted
				the number of com– municants parish by parish. Despite uncertainty regarding both the number of parishes comprising London and the ratio by which the population counted in the chantry
				certificates should be enlarged (its numbers are agreed by all to be low), Vanessa Hardings range of figures for 1548 is not dissimilar: 56, 450 to 60, O00 (rounded). By the time of
				the 1582 lay subsidy Steve Rappaport calculates the city&apos;s size (excluding Southwark) at 102, 600, and by 1600, the end of the century, at 150, O00.2 Hardings estimate for 1600 is
				about the same for the middle range: 131, O00 to 152, 000.17</p>

				<div>
					<head>Religious Houses</head> 
					<p>The most important monastic foundations in the London area were two: St Paul&apos;s, discussed above, and
				the Benedictine abbey of St Peter, Westminster, whose dramatic records will be treated in M€₨₨₮£৳£x €₭₯l¥₨€₭₩ W£৳૱₱€₭৳૱£৲, forthcoming in the REED series. Besides these earliest
				seventh– and eighth–century foundations, the capital had at least twelve hospitals, six for the sick and six for the poor: two houses of Austin canons (Holy Trinity Priory and St
				Bartholomew&apos;s Priory): two or three establishments of the military orders: houses of the four orders of friars plus other fraternal orders, and the minoresses. St Helen&apos;s
				Priory, along with Westminster, was the only Benedictine house, and St Mary Graces the only Cistercian foundation. The majoi houses and hospitals spread out around the city&apos;s edge
				like a fan, enclosing it west to east. (In fact several houses commonly thought of as London ones, like the Charterhouse, St Mary Clerkenwell, Sheen, and Syon, lay in Middlesex.) The
				mendicant orders– Austin friars, Blackfriars, and Greyfriars– were established before the end of the twelfth century inside the walls while Whitefriars lay just outside to the west.
				From these two dozen or so religious houses (not counting St Paul&apos;s and Westminster) dramatic records are found at four: Holy Trinity Priory, founded e 1108: St Mary within
				Cripplegate or Elsyng Spital, in 1331: St Helen&apos;s, in the early thirteenth century: and St Mary Graces, in 1350.</p>
					</div>
				<div>
					<head>Ecclesiastical Courts</head> 
					<p>A myriad of church courts with interlocking
				jurisdictions sat in London.1 Sadly much of their rich material has perished, that of both the elevated courts and the lower ones. (Details of the survival of various kinds of court
				records are given in the Documents section, pp xcviii–xcix.) At the highest level was the archbishop of Canterbury&apos;s court of Audience. The appeal court of the province of
				Canterbury, the court of Arches, has been called, the most important ecclesiastical court in England in the Middle Ages.2 It met at St Mary le Bow and was presided over by the
				archbishop&apos;s official. London had thirteen peculiars as well, in whose parishes judicial matters were referred to the archbishop rather than the bishop of London: the dean of the peculiars was the rector of the parish of St Mary le Bow (St
				Mary of Arches): these records have perished.</p> 
					<p>Moving downward from the metropolitical court of Audience, appellate court, and court of peculiars, we come to the courts of the bishop of
				London. At the higher level, the consistory court, the judge was the official principal: this court heard material from the entire diocese, primarily civil suits though also criminal
				and testamentary cases. Attached to this court were the bishop&apos;s registrar and a group of apparitors who delivered court summonses. Pleas and actions were written and each step
				required a separate appearance in court, so cases were often carried over several terms. Its complexity meant that professional help was needed, with proctors to represent defendants
				in court and advocates to plead the case. Court procedure had three phases: litis contestatio or presentation of the charges: probatio or trial: and sentencia or judgment. The
				deposition books (known as examination books before 161 1) record the sworn statements of witnesses. This court convened at least weekly in the long chapel of Si Paul&apos;s Cathedral.</p>
				
				<p>In the bishop&apos;s lower court, the commissary, the judge was the commissary general. This court&apos;s power was exercised over the city of London and the deaneries of Middlesex and
				Barking: its mandate included both crimes and testaments, and its volume of business was larger than that of the consistory court. Summary proceedings were given viva voce: litigants
				were generally not represented and the case was decided by the judge on the basis of compurga* tion– that is, the defendant produced three or four witnesses of good repute to swear to
				his innocence. If complications arose the case was referred upward to the consistory court. A brief record of appearances and pleadings was kept by the court scribe, usually contained
				within a single short entry. Sexual matters were frequently presented here and after the Reformation, sabbatarian ones.</p> 
				
				<p>Below the bishop&apos;s commissary court were the courts of the
				four archdeaconries of the London diocese, London, Middlesex, Colchester, and Essex. Richard Wunderli observes that the jurisdiction of the first two overlapped with that of the
				bishop&apos;s commissary court. He suggests a division of responsibility in which the archidiaconal court oversaw the physical condition of the parish fabric, since no such cases
				appear in either consistory or commissary court records, while London churchwardens accounts do occasionally record various responses to the archdeacon– the figure to whom the wardens
				were responsible, rather than to the bishop&apos;s officials.৳ </p>
				
				<p>The level at which judicial process most closely touched ordinary people&apos;s lives was that of the visitation. Held
				usually every three years by the bishop, often interspersed with archidiaconal visits and occasionally metropolitical ones as well, the questions from these occasions survive from the
				middle of the sixteenth century when they began to be printed, though Richard Arnold&apos;s C¥৳૱¢₱৳ of L¢₭₨¢₭ (Antwerp, c 1503: s7c: 782) gives two sets of visitation articles
				administered at his own parish of St Magnus, from the end of the fifteenth century: But the visitation articles are questions to which we do not have replies since the churchwardens
				answers have universally perished. Sometimes in serious matters those answers, which had beer given to the diocesan registrar, were submitted to the chancellor for legal action, and
				the resulting court cases appeared in the archidiaconal act books.৳ Replies to these questions, if we had them, would take us very close to parish playing. </p>
				
				<p>The
				source of these interrogations was, in the Stuart period, the IAI canons passed by the convocation of Canterbury in 1604, a revision in the charge of Bishop Bancroft of London. It was
				the first complete and coherent codification of English ecclesiastical practice though Gerald Bray writes that its character as an unsatisfactory hotch–potch has long been recog*
				nized. / Bancroft&apos;s 1508 articles as bishop had been influential but his metropolitical articles, compiled for ten dioceses in 1605, were the most widely imitated of any in the
				early Stuart Church and were dominant through 1637.3 In 1640 Peter Heylyn devised new articles for the London diocese, giving the authority for each question, and these were officially
				commissioned as the standard set, used throughout the southern province thereafter. (Though [ames Is Book of Sports in 1618 allowed various old pastimes, including May games and
				Whitsun ales, the ecclesiastical articles continued to forbid these practices). S6 </p></div></div>
