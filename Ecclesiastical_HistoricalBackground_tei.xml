				<lb facs='#facs_1_r1l1' n='N001'/>Historical Background
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r1l2' n='N002'/>Cathedral and Diocese
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r1l3' n='N003'/>Although there is some evidence, archaeological and historical, for Christianity in London in
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r1l4' n='N004'/>the fourth century (Restitutus, bishop of London, attended the council of Arles in 314), the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r1l5' n='N005'/>visible history of the church in London really begins with the establishment in 604 of St Paul&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r1l6' n='N006'/>Cathedral, probably on one of the two low hills where the Romans built this city. St Augustines
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r1l7' n='N007'/>mission had landed in 597, commanded by Pope Gregory to establish sees at London and Tork
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r1l8' n='N008'/>and seven years later Athelberht of kent built the cathedral for London&apos;s bishop, Mellitus,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r1l9' n='N009'/>the friend of Augustine. Athelberht&apos;s death brought a reversion to paganism and Mellitus
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r1l10' n='N010'/>exile however, and the see of London was not re–established until late in the century by St
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r1l11' n='N011'/>Erkenwald (acceded 675), called St Paul&apos;s second founder, whose relics in the Middle Ages
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r1l12' n='N012'/>were the cathedral&apos;s greatest treasure.2
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r1l13' n='N013'/>In the ninth century the Viking attacks of 842, 851, and 871, and the occupation of London,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r1l14' n='N014'/>must have had an effect on religious life in the capital but the evidence is scarce. The lives of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r1l15' n='N015'/>the great bishops of the tenth century, however– Theodred (acceded between 900 and 926) and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r1l16' n='N016'/>Dunstan (between 957 and 950)– provide more evidence. Dunstan in particular is associated
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r1l17' n='N017'/>with monastic reform and specifically with the reform of the Westminster community. His
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r1l18' n='N018'/>successor Alfstan (between 950 and 964) was responsible for rebuilding St Pauls within a year
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r1l19' n='N019'/>after a great fire in 962, the first of many that were to mark its history.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r1l20' n='N020'/>Edward the Confessor&apos;s transfer of the royal capital from Winchester&apos;s Old Minster to
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r1l21' n='N021'/>London&apos;s Westminster contributed to the importance of St Paul&apos;s and of its bishop. Edward
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r1l22' n='N022'/>appointed the first two Norman bishops of London, Robert of [umieges (1044) and William
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r1l23' n='N023'/>(between 1051 and 1075), the latter subsequently regarded as instrumental in the royal grant
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r1l24' n='N024'/>of a charter to London and for this reason commemorated in a mayoral procession to St Paul&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r1l25' n='N025'/>as late as the seventeenth century.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r1l26' n='N026'/>The second of the cathedral&apos;s three great fires, in 1087, produced a significant rebuilding of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r1l27' n='N027'/>the cathedral begun by Bishop Maurice. It was perhaps largely finished by 1175, dedicated in
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r1l28' n='N028'/>1240, and finally completed in the 1320s.s Bishop of London Gilbert Foliot&apos;s claim, in 1160,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r1l29' n='N029'/>to metropolitan status for himself and London, and his refusal of subordination to the arch–
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r1l30' n='N030'/>bishop or church of Canterbury, must have been to some extent connected with the growing
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r1l31' n='N031'/>physical pre–eminence of the cathedral and perhaps also with the translation to it of St Erkenwald&apos;s

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r1l3' n='N003'/>relics, which had taken place in 1148.S (The saint&apos;s two feasts were re–established by Bishop

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r1l7' n='N007'/>the city walls and all houses in the city, while its elegant and sumptuous spire, perhaps the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r1l8' n='N008'/>tallest in Europe, rose higher than any building in London before 1064./ The cathedral&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r1l9' n='N009'/>physical fabric has regularly risen and fallen: besides the fires of 962 and 1087 already mentioned,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r1l10' n='N010'/>there were conflagrations in 1136 and in 1445, after which the spire was not repaired until
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r1l11' n='N011'/>1462, when a copper and gilt weathercock, originally erected in 1421, was replaced. The third
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r1l12' n='N012'/>great fire occurred in 1561 when the S00 spire was struck by lightning: a smoke was espied.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r1l13' n='N013'/>But sodeinly after, as it wer in a momente, the flame brake furth in a circle like a garlande.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r1l14' n='N014'/>within a quarter of an howre... the crosse &amp; the Egle on the toppe fell downe vpon the south
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r1l15' n='N015'/>crosse Ile.8 The subsequent collection of funds, like the national collection begun seventy
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r1l16' n='N016'/>years later in 1631 to respond to general decay of the building, was controversial, since from
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r1l17' n='N017'/>Elizabeth&apos;s accession onward the form of the building, even its existence, was strongly tied to
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r1l18' n='N018'/>approval or disapproval of differing religious positions.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r1l19' n='N019'/>From the twelfth century St Paul&apos;s central role in London spectacle was established, not only
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r1l20' n='N020'/>in religious procession within the cathedral and its precinct, but in the secular space to the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r1l21' n='N021'/>north, in Cheapside, which became the principal section of the route for royal entries and for
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r1l22' n='N022'/>reception of visitors from abroad. At least by the early fifteenth century, besides the mayoral
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r1l23' n='N023'/>election procession on 28 October there were seven other days, all in winter, when the mayor
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r1l24' n='N024'/>aldermen, and guilds ceremonially attended St Paul&apos;s, while the days after Pentecost were
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r1l25' n='N025'/>filled with long–established archidiaconal processions. The symbolic closeness, even identity,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r1l26' n='N026'/>of civic and religious authority is shown by the ceremonial on six special feasts when mayori
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r1l27' n='N027'/>and aldermen heard vespers at St Paul&apos;s, standing in ranked order along the choir, the mayori
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r1l28' n='N028'/>next to the dean&apos;s stall.:
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r1l29' n='N029'/>The cathedral served both city and kingdom and its importance not only in civic but in
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r1l30' n='N030'/>national life was underlined by the celebration of royal victories (Henry vII after Stoke), royal
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r1l31' n='N031'/>marriages (Henry VII1 and katherine of Aragon), and royal political alliances ([ames I and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r1l32' n='N032'/>Christian of Denmark) which took place within its walls. As the cathedral provided the great
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r1l33' n='N033'/>stage for these moments of national affirmation, so too it was the venue for the display of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r1l34' n='N034'/>clashing religious beliefs, particularly after the death of Henry VIII when for the rest of the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r1l35' n='N035'/>century the entire kingdom struggled with the violent realities of religious change. Especially
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r1l36' n='N036'/>relevant were the conflicts centred on St Paul&apos;s liturgical observance, an important index to
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r1l37' n='N037'/>the country&apos;s theological shifts. At the cathedral the simplifying of religious observance under
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r1l38' n='N038'/>Edward, the reinstitution of traditional ceremony under Mary (including the feast of St
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r1l39' n='N039'/>Erkenwald), the Elizabethan completion of the Reformation, and the Laudian liturgical reform
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r1l40' n='N040'/>reflected in condensed form the events taking place in the country at large. That convocation
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r1l41' n='N041'/>met regularly at St Paul&apos;s meant that these visual statements were regularly accompanied by
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r1l42' n='N042'/>theological ones. It was the 1563 convocation of the southern province whose first session
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r1l43' n='N043'/>met at St Paul&apos;s for instance, which produced the doctrinal consensus embodied in the Thirty*
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r1l44' n='N044'/>Nine Articles.

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r1l3' n='N003'/>Though the cathedral and its precinct were important civic spaces, they were famously

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r1l14' n='N014'/>activity liturgical, political, and sometimes simply dramatic. The precinct&apos;s walls, gates, and to
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r1l15' n='N015'/>some extent buildings seem to have been largely in place by the twelfth century.8 Sparrow
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r1l16' n='N016'/>Simpson asks how many people resided in the precinct and a recent assessment suggests it
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r1l17' n='N017'/>might have housed as many as 300, a number equivalent to the communicants in a middle
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r1l18' n='N018'/>sized city parish.1/ The precinct was the locale for many of the dramatic occurrences presented
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r1l19' n='N019'/>in this volume: for instance the plays in the almoner&apos;s house under Sebastian Westcote (attend–

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r1l21' n='N021'/>to clerical houses, and the spectacles and sermons offered at Paul&apos;s Cross (see Figure I, p xxxix)
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r1l22' n='N022'/>The cathedral precinct, sheltering its important cross and pulpit, thus offered the same mode
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r1l23' n='N023'/>of churchyard with a cross found on a smaller scale in many London parishes.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r1l24' n='N024'/>Located in the northeast corner, near the site of the ancient folkmoot, the cross was firs€

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r1l33' n='N033'/>ten years more.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r1l34' n='N034'/>Parishes
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r1l35' n='N035'/>The remarkable number of London parishes has been universally noticed. William Fitzstephen,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r1l36' n='N036'/>writing in the 1170s at the end of the period during which the parishes were taking shape, says
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r1l37' n='N037'/>London and its suburbs had thirteen greater conventual churches and 126 lesser parochial
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r1l38' n='N038'/>churches, and Christopher Brooke judges that before 1250 this seems to have been the record
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r1l39' n='N039'/>in Western Christendom.18 The familiar line of development from minster to parish, beginning
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r1l40' n='N040'/>in the Anglo–Saxon period and largely completed by 1200, has been traced in London by
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r1l41' n='N041'/>Brooke, who notes the early existence of St Gregory&apos;s and St Faiths parishes as probable off*
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r1l42' n='N042'/>shoots of St Pauls. (St Faiths dedication comes perhaps from the ninth century.) Brooke also

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r1l4' n='N004'/>of St Andrew Holborn, recorded in a mid–tenth–century charter, and St Brides, built on an
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r1l5' n='N005'/>ancient Roman cemetery possibly in the tenth or eleventh century:
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r1l6' n='N006'/>Focusing on eastern London ]eremy Haslam has posited a slightly different pattern of
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r1l7' n='N007'/>evolution: an intentional creation of new minsters in the restoration of London after the ninth*
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r1l8' n='N008'/>century Viking raids, of which the first and oldest would be All Hallows Barking, covering
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r1l9' n='N009'/>much if not most of the eastern part of the Cirty.21
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r1l10' n='N010'/>Founded mostly between the tenth and twelfth centuries, with a proliferation of tiny parishes
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r1l11' n='N011'/>in the eleventh century, the roster of London parishes was largely complete by around 1200.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r1l12' n='N012'/>As in other English cities these many small parishes were served by small churches, though the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r1l13' n='N013'/>four churches of the friars offered large interiors. Parish boundaries did not follow those of the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r1l14' n='N014'/>wards, being often determined by ownership of land, and Brooke concludes that we must be
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r1l15' n='N015'/>looking at the outlines of the tenements and messuages of groups of neighbours who formed
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r1l16' n='N016'/>522
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r1l17' n='N017'/>the early parishes.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r1l18' n='N018'/>In London the ties between parishes and the religious houses were close. Thirteenth– and
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r1l19' n='N019'/>fifteenth–century lists of London parishes survive, with valuations: in the earlier list the citys
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r1l20' n='N020'/>ninety–two churches are annotated as in the patronage of either a religious house or a private
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r1l21' n='N021'/>person.2 In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries there were lawsuits, some of which the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r1l22' n='N022'/>bishop of London joined, to relieve some parishes of these payments to institutions. The
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r1l23' n='N023'/>fourteenth and fifteenth centuries saw the appropriation of several parishes to monasteries: foi
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r1l24' n='N024'/>instance St Mary Graces appropriated All Hallows Staining, and the female abbey of Barking
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r1l25' n='N025'/>in 1385 appropriated the parish of All Hallows Barking. At the end of the fourteenth century
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r1l26' n='N026'/>St Paul&apos;s Cathedral held the advowson of nineteen parishes.25 This closeness took another form
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r1l27' n='N027'/>when at the Dissolution of the London religious houses in 1530 four monastic churches
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r1l28' n='N028'/>became parochial.2
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r1l29' n='N029'/>The middle of the fourteenth century saw several important developments in parish life
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r1l30' n='N030'/>Perhaps most central was the emergence of churchwardens and their various duties, beginning
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r1l31' n='N031'/>with fiscal responsibility for the fabric but developing rapidly in other directions as well
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r1l32' n='N032'/>Beat kimin&apos;s list of Peterborough wardens duties is almost comically comprehensive: they
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r1l33' n='N033'/>administered, bought, and sold property, organized collections on certain feasts, lent out money
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r1l34' n='N034'/>and various church goods, received testamentary bequests and contributions by local guilds,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r1l35' n='N035'/>staged entertainments and demanded fees for bell–ringing or burial, while spending money
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r1l36' n='N036'/>on church maintenance, ornaments, salaries, subsidies, bridge–building, legal matters, priests
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r1l37' n='N037'/>and ceremonies.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r1l38' n='N038'/>The earliest English churchwardens accounts come from Bridgwater, Somerset, in 1318.2
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r1l39' n='N039'/>In London the earliest accounts belong to St Mary at Hill c 1420 (there are inventories, pre–

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r1l41' n='N041'/>of parishes have records from the 1450s: All Hallows Barking and St Nicholas Shambles,

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r1l6' n='N006'/>The development of chantries within London parishes was also a feature of the mid–four*–
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r1l7' n='N007'/>teenth century. Chantries had both negative and positive effects for the parish: the increase in
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r1l8' n='N008'/>staffing they produced was recognized both as a financial problem (since the original endowment
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r1l9' n='N009'/>was sometimes inadequate) and a pastoral desideratum (since the lightness of chantry duties
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r1l10' n='N010'/>made possible richer parish liturgical, musical, and educational services). Indeed it has recently
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r1l11' n='N011'/>been claimed that the managerial and liturgical demands imposed by these testamentary
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r1l12' n='N012'/>arrangements for long–term commemoration were responsible for parish growth in adminis
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r1l13' n='N013'/>trative, musical, and liturgical complexity: Nevertheless as early as 1345 the mayor complained
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r1l14' n='N014'/>to the dean and chapter of St Paul&apos;s that there were too few priests to sing at the cathedral in
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r1l15' n='N015'/>proportion to the number staffing the chantries. 28
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r1l16' n='N016'/>Finally this period also saw the growth of the parish brotherhoods whose popularity continuec
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r1l17' n='N017'/>strong until their abolition by the Chantries Act in 1547. 2 Between the middle of the four
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r1l18' n='N018'/>teenth century and sixteenth century, 176 such London fraternities have been counted. In
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r1l19' n='N019'/>addition to the brotherhood property and possessions listed under parish holdings, the Chantry
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r1l20' n='N020'/>Certificate of 1548 shows that ten London brotherhoods were wealthy enough to file returns
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r1l21' n='N021'/>separate from those of the parish. At least three of these parish fraternities owned halls and
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r1l22' n='N022'/>in one of them, Trinity Hall at St Botolph without Aldersgate, playing took place.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r1l23' n='N023'/>Attempts to use parish space, both in churches and churchyards, for non–religious purposes
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r1l24' n='N024'/>began very early. Bishop of London Fulk Bassets mid–thirteenth–century strictures against
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r1l25' n='N025'/>plays and wrestling in churches and chapels may be considered just a few of many attempts
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r1l26' n='N026'/>to regulate the non–religious use of parish sacred space (see pp 3–4). In 1303, for instance, the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r1l27' n='N027'/>rector of St Bartholomew the Less was reproved by the archbishop of Canterbury for allowing
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r1l28' n='N028'/>his parishioners to use the cemetery as their marketplace for timber, hay, and other merchandise. 2
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r1l29' n='N029'/>Open space connected with parish churches had a myriad of uses, yet it may be that in the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r1l30' n='N030'/>heyday of parish playing these spaces were being reduced. In the fifteenth and early sixteenth
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r1l31' n='N031'/>centuries many London churches were engaged in extensive building and decorating, a process
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r1l32' n='N032'/>that, according to one historian, converted a small Romanesque box of the eleventh or twelfth
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r1l33' n='N033'/>centuries into a complex rectangle of aisles and chapels, accentuated in the fifteenth century
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r1l34' n='N034'/>by the addition of towers.2 The gain in beauty and comfort may have come at the expense of
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r1l35' n='N035'/>disposable open space outside the church. Nonetheless London&apos;s dramatized Palm Sunday
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r1l36' n='N036'/>liturgy, with its costumed and wigged singing prophets, took place mostly in the churchyard
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r1l37' n='N037'/>where the churchyard cross was the destination of the festal procession. Parish fund–raising
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r1l38' n='N038'/>plays took place here as well, the most notable being the summer–long plays licensed by
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r1l39' n='N039'/>the city.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r1l40' n='N040'/>Early population is a controversial subject and medieval historians differ as to the size of
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r1l41' n='N041'/>London before the Black Death.2 Based on a study of property₯holding in five parishes at the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r1l42' n='N042'/>eastern end of Cheapside, Derek Reene suggested that in 1300 population might have been as
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r1l43' n='N043'/>high as 100, O00 people or more. Using tax returns and trade figures Pamela Nightingale has
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r1l44' n='N044'/>opted for a more conservative figure of about 6O, OO0, suggesting that different parts of the city

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r1l3' n='N003'/>experienced different patterns of growth. After the several fourteenth–century episodes of the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r1l4' n='N004'/>plague however, the population of London was in 1400 probably only half what it had been
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r1l5' n='N005'/>in 1300, and keene has suggested that the city did not regain its pre–plague size until 1600.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r1l6' n='N006'/>The estimates of SO, O00 people in 1500 and 70, O00 in 1550 offered by Roger Finlay have
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r1l7' n='N007'/>become widely accepted. The latter figure depends on the crucially important population
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r1l8' n='N008'/>marker of mid–century, the chantry returns of 1546–8 which counted the number of com–

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r1l12' n='N012'/>for 1548 is not dissimilar: 56, 450 to 60, O00 (rounded). By the time of the 1582 lay subsidy

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r1l16' n='N016'/>Religious Houses
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r1l17' n='N017'/>The most important monastic foundations in the London area were two: St Paul&apos;s, discussed
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r1l18' n='N018'/>above, and the Benedictine abbey of St Peter, Westminster, whose dramatic records will be

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r1l20' n='N020'/>seventh– and eighth–century foundations, the capital had at least twelve hospitals, six for the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r1l21' n='N021'/>sick and six for the poor: two houses of Austin canons (Holy Trinity Priory and St Bartholomew&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r1l22' n='N022'/>Priory): two or three establishments of the military orders: houses of the four orders of friars
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r1l23' n='N023'/>plus other fraternal orders, and the minoresses. St Helen&apos;s Priory, along with Westminster, was
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r1l24' n='N024'/>the only Benedictine house, and St Mary Graces the only Cistercian foundation. The majoi
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r1l25' n='N025'/>houses and hospitals spread out around the city&apos;s edge like a fan, enclosing it west to east. (In
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r1l26' n='N026'/>fact several houses commonly thought of as London ones, like the Charterhouse, St Mary
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r1l27' n='N027'/>Clerkenwell, Sheen, and Syon, lay in Middlesex.) The mendicant orders– Austin friars,
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r1l28' n='N028'/>Blackfriars, and Greyfriars– were established before the end of the twelfth century inside the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r1l29' n='N029'/>walls while Whitefriars lay just outside to the west. From these two dozen or so religious houses
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r1l30' n='N030'/>(not counting St Paul&apos;s and Westminster) dramatic records are found at four: Holy Trinity
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r1l31' n='N031'/>Priory, founded e 1108: St Mary within Cripplegate or Elsyng Spital, in 1331: St Helen&apos;s, in

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r1l34' n='N034'/>A myriad of church courts with interlocking jurisdictions sat in London.1 Sadly much of their
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r1l35' n='N035'/>rich material has perished, that of both the elevated courts and the lower ones. (Details of the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r1l36' n='N036'/>survival of various kinds of court records are given in the Documents section, pp xcviii–xcix.)
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r1l37' n='N037'/>At the highest level was the archbishop of Canterbury&apos;s court of Audience. The appeal court
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r1l38' n='N038'/>of the province of Canterbury, the court of Arches, has been called, the most important
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r1l39' n='N039'/>ecclesiastical court in England in the Middle Ages.2 It met at St Mary le Bow and was presided
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r1l40' n='N040'/>over by the archbishop&apos;s official. London had thirteen peculiars as well, in whose parishes

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r1l1' n='N001'/>HISTORICAL BACkGROUND
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r1l2' n='N002'/>judicial matters were referred to the archbishop rather than the bishop of London: the dean
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r1l3' n='N003'/>of the peculiars was the rector of the parish of St Mary le Bow (St Mary of Arches): these
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r1l4' n='N004'/>records have perished.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r1l5' n='N005'/>Moving downward from the metropolitical court of Audience, appellate court, and court of
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r1l6' n='N006'/>peculiars, we come to the courts of the bishop of London. At the higher level, the consistory
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r1l7' n='N007'/>court, the judge was the official principal: this court heard material from the entire diocese,
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r1l8' n='N008'/>primarily civil suits though also criminal and testamentary cases. Attached to this court were
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r1l9' n='N009'/>the bishop&apos;s registrar and a group of apparitors who delivered court summonses. Pleas and
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r1l10' n='N010'/>actions were written and each step required a separate appearance in court, so cases were often
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r1l11' n='N011'/>carried over several terms. Its complexity meant that professional help was needed, with proctors
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r1l12' n='N012'/>to represent defendants in court and advocates to plead the case. Court procedure had three
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r1l13' n='N013'/>phases: litis contestatio or presentation of the charges: probatio or trial: and sentencia
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r1l14' n='N014'/>or judgment. The deposition books (known as examination books before 161 1) record the
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r1l15' n='N015'/>sworn statements of witnesses. This court convened at least weekly in the long chapel of Si
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r1l16' n='N016'/>Paul&apos;s Cathedral.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r1l17' n='N017'/>In the bishop&apos;s lower court, the commissary, the judge was the commissary general. This
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r1l18' n='N018'/>court&apos;s power was exercised over the city of London and the deaneries of Middlesex and
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r1l19' n='N019'/>Barking: its mandate included both crimes and testaments, and its volume of business was
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r1l20' n='N020'/>larger than that of the consistory court. Summary proceedings were given viva voce: litigants
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r1l21' n='N021'/>were generally not represented and the case was decided by the judge on the basis of compurga*
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r1l22' n='N022'/>tion– that is, the defendant produced three or four witnesses of good repute to swear to his
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r1l23' n='N023'/>innocence. If complications arose the case was referred upward to the consistory court. A brief
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r1l24' n='N024'/>record of appearances and pleadings was kept by the court scribe, usually contained within a
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r1l25' n='N025'/>single short entry. Sexual matters were frequently presented here and after the Reformation,
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r1l26' n='N026'/>sabbatarian ones
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r1l27' n='N027'/>Below the bishop&apos;s commissary court were the courts of the four archdeaconries of the
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r1l28' n='N028'/>London diocese, London, Middlesex, Colchester, and Essex. Richard Wunderli observes that
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r1l29' n='N029'/>the jurisdiction of the first two overlapped with that of the bishop&apos;s commissary court. He
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r1l30' n='N030'/>suggests a division of responsibility in which the archidiaconal court oversaw the physical
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r1l31' n='N031'/>condition of the parish fabric, since no such cases appear in either consistory or commissary
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r1l32' n='N032'/>court records, while London churchwardens accounts do occasionally record various responses
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r1l33' n='N033'/>to the archdeacon– the figure to whom the wardens were responsible, rather than to the
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r1l34' n='N034'/>bishop&apos;s officials.৳
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r1l35' n='N035'/>The level at which judicial process most closely touched ordinary people&apos;s lives was that of
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r1l36' n='N036'/>the visitation. Held usually every three years by the bishop, often interspersed with archidiaconal
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r1l37' n='N037'/>visits and occasionally metropolitical ones as well, the questions from these occasions survive
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r1l38' n='N038'/>from the middle of the sixteenth century when they began to be printed, though Richard

				<lb facs='#facs_8_r1l11' n='N011'/>Church and were dominant through 1637.3 In 1640 Peter Heylyn devised new articles for the
