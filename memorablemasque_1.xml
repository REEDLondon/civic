            <p>Records of Early English Drama (REED) is an international scholarly project that is
               establishing for the first time the context from which the drama of Shakespeare and
               his contemporaries grew. Founded in 1976, REED has worked since then to locate,
               transcribe, and edit historical documents containing evidence of drama, secular
               music, and other communal entertainment and ceremony from the Middle Ages until 1642,
               when the Puritans closed the London theatres.</p>
